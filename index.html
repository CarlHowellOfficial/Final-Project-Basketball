          <p>The history of basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less injury-prone sport than football. Naismith was a 31-year old graduate student
            when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during the winters.[1] The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed, first in America and then in other parts of the world. After
            basketball became established in American colleges, the professional game followed. The American National Basketball Association (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the end of the century, and
            basketball became an integral part of American culture.

          <p> Kobe Bryant decided to go straight to the NBA from high school due of having good grades and high SAT scores back then. In 1996 NBA draft Kobe was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick and then traded to La Lakers
            or Los Angeles Lakers.
            Second season of Kobe Bryant’ career, he was voted as a starter for the 1998 All-Star Game, becoming the youngest All-Star in the history of Basketball Association at the age of 19.
            November 2015, after 20 years of playing basketball, Kobe Bryant announced that he would retire by the end of the season. Kobe wrote on The Players’ Tribune website, “This season is all I have left to give. My heart can take the pounding.
            My mind can handle the grind, but my body knows it’s time to say goodbye.”
